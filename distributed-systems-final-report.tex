\section*{Disclaimer (if needed)}

During the preparation of this work, the author(s) used [NAME TOOL / SERVICE] to [REASON].

After using this tool/service, 
the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed 
and take(s) full responsibility for the content of the final report/artifact.

\section*{Quick \LaTeX{} suggestions}

If you need to cite a reference, you can use the \texttt{cite} command, 
like providing the BibTex key of some entry in the \texttt{references.bib} file, 
e.g.: \cite{adams1995hitchhiker}.

You can find pre-coocked BibTex entries for most Computer Science papers on \href{https://dblp.uni-trier.de/}{DBLP}.

If you need to include an image,
let \LaTeX{} decide where to put it by using the \texttt{figure} environment,
with a \texttt{includegraphics} command inside it.
%
If your need to reference a figure,
use the \texttt{label} command to assign a label to the figure,
and then use the \texttt{cref} command to reference it.
%
Put figures in the \texttt{figures} folder.
%
A complete example is shown in \cref{fig:universe}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/universe.jpg}
    \caption{This is an example image}
    \label{fig:universe}
\end{figure}

Do \textbf{not} put any placement constraint on figures,
such as \texttt{[h]} or \texttt{[h!]}.
%
Same considerations apply for other floating elements 
(e.g. tables, algorithms, listings, etc.).

Do \textbf{not} use the \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} or \texttt{\textbackslash newline} commands to break lines.

Just leave an empty line between two paragraphs to start a new one.
%
The new line will be automatically indented.
%
This is intended: it is the \LaTeX{} way to separate capoverses.

\section{Concept}\label{concept}

Here you should explain:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The type of product developed with that project, for example (non-exhaustive):
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Application (with GUI, be it mobile, web, or desktop)
    \item Command-line application (CLI could be used by humans or scripts)
    \item Library
    \item Web-service(s)
  \end{itemize}

  \item Use case description:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{what} is the software doing?
    \item \emph{where} are the users?
    \item \emph{when} and \emph{how frequently} do they interact with the system?
    \item \emph{how} do they \emph{interact} with the system? which \emph{devices} are they using?
    \item does the system need to \emph{store} user's \textbf{data}? \emph{which}? \emph{where}?
    \item most likely, there will be \emph{multiple} \textbf{roles}
  \end{itemize}

  \item Why is distribution needed?
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item geographically distributed environments?
    \item computation speedup?
    \item resource sharing?
    \item fault tolerance?
    \item other reasons?
  \end{itemize}
  %
  In any case, please elaborate.
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements Elicitation and Analysis}\label{requirements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The requirements must explain \textbf{what} (not how) the software
  being produced should do.
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item you should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on
    what you want the application to do.
  \end{itemize}

  \item Requirements must be clearly identified, and possibly numbered

  \item Requirements are divided into:
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Functional}: some functionality the software should provide to the user

    \item \textbf{Non-functional}: requirements that do not directly concern behavioural aspects, such as consistency, availability, etc.

    \item \textbf{Implementation}: constrain the entire phase of system realization, 
    for instance by requiring the use of a specific programming language and/or a specific software tool
    %
    \begin{itemize}
      \item these constraints should be adequately justified by political / economic / administrative reasons\ldots{}
      \item \ldots{} otherwise, implementation choices should emerge \emph{as  a consequence of} design
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \item If there are domain-specific terms, these should be explained in a glossary
  
  \item Each requirement must have its own \textbf{acceptance criterion}
  %
  \begin{itemize}
    \item these will be important for the validation phase
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Distributed System Features}
\label{ds-features}

Motivate which distributed system features are relevant for your project, and which are not.
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item transparency
  \begin{itemize}
    \item does your system need to hide distribution details from users or developers?
    \item is it important that failures, location, or replication are invisible?
  \end{itemize}

  \item fault tolerance, dependability -- availability, reliability, integrity, maintainability, safety
  \begin{itemize}
    \item what happens if a component fails? is uninterrupted service required?
    \item is data loss or corruption unacceptable?
    \item how quickly must the system recover from faults?
  \end{itemize}

  \item scalability
  \begin{itemize}
    \item will the system need to handle increasing numbers of users, requests, or data?
    \item is it expected to grow over time?
  \end{itemize}

  \item security, trust
  \begin{itemize}
    \item is sensitive data being processed or stored?
    \item are there multiple user roles with different permissions?
    \item is authentication or authorization required?
  \end{itemize}

  \item resource sharing
  \begin{itemize}
    \item do multiple users or components need access to shared resources?
    \item is coordination or synchronization needed?
  \end{itemize}

  \item openness, interoperability, heterogeneity of components
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Will your system interact with external systems or use components built with different technologies?
    \item Is standardization or compatibility important?
  \end{itemize}

  \item evolvability, maintainability
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Will the system need to be updated or extended after deployment?
    \item Is long-term maintenance a concern?
  \end{itemize}

  \item performance, concurrency, computation / communication efficiency, bandwidth
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Are there strict requirements on response time or throughput?
    \item Will many operations happen in parallel?
    \item Is network usage a concern?
  \end{itemize}

  \item economy, costs  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Are there budget constraints for development, deployment, or operation?
    \item Is minimizing resource usage important?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}\label{design}

This chapter explains the strategies used to meet the requirements identified in the analysis. 
%
Ideally, the design should be the same, regardless of the technological choices made during the implementation phase.

\begin{quote}
