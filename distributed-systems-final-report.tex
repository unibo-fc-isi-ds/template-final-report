\section*{Disclaimer (if needed)}

During the preparation of this work, the author(s) used [NAME TOOL / SERVICE] to [REASON].

After using this tool/service, 
the author(s) reviewed and edited the content as needed 
and take(s) full responsibility for the content of the final report/artifact.

\section*{Quick \LaTeX{} suggestions}

If you need to cite a reference, you can use the \texttt{cite} command, 
like providing the BibTex key of some entry in the \texttt{references.bib} file, 
e.g.: \cite{adams1995hitchhiker}.

You can find pre-coocked BibTex entries for most Computer Science papers on \href{https://dblp.uni-trier.de/}{DBLP}.

If you need to include an image,
let \LaTeX{} decide where to put it by using the \texttt{figure} environment,
with a \texttt{includegraphics} command inside it.
%
If your need to reference a figure,
use the \texttt{label} command to assign a label to the figure,
and then use the \texttt{cref} command to reference it.
%
Put figures in the \texttt{figures} folder.
%
A complete example is shown in \cref{fig:universe}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/universe.jpg}
    \caption{This is an example image}
    \label{fig:universe}
\end{figure}

Do not put any placement constraint on figures,
such as \texttt{[h]} or \texttt{[h!]}.
%
Same considerations apply for other floating elements 
(e.g. tables, algorithms, listings, etc.).

Do not use the \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} or \texttt{\textbackslash newline} commands to break lines.

Just leave an empty line between two paragraphs to start a new one.
%
The new line will be automatically indented.
%
This is intended: it is the \LaTeX{} way to separate capoverses.

\section{Concept}\label{concept}

Here you should explain:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The type of product developed with that project, for example
  (non-exhaustive):

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Application (with GUI, be it mobile, web, or desktop)
    \item Command-line application (CLI could be used by humans or scripts)
    \item Library
    \item Web-service(s)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Use case collection

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{where} are the users?
    \item \emph{when} and \emph{how frequently} do they interact with the
    system?
    \item \emph{how} do they \emph{interact} with the system? which
    \emph{devices} are they using?
    \item does the system need to \emph{store} user's \textbf{data}?
    \emph{which}? \emph{where}?
    \item most likely, there will be \emph{multiple} \textbf{roles}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements}\label{requirements}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The requirements must explain \textbf{what} (not how) the software
  being produced should do.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item you should not focus on the particular problems, but exclusively on
    what you want the application to do.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Requirements must be clearly identified, and possibly numbered
  \item Requirements are divided into:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Functional}: some functionality the software should provide
    to the user
    \item \textbf{Non-functional}: requirements that do not directly concern
    behavioural aspects, such as consistency, availability, etc.
    \item \textbf{Implementation}: constrain the entire phase of system
    realization, for instance by requiring the use of a specific
    programming language and/or a specific software tool

    \begin{itemize}
      \item these constraints should be adequately justified by political /
      economic / administrative reasons\ldots{}
      \item \ldots{} otherwise, implementation choices should emerge \emph{as
      a consequence of} design
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item If there are domain-specific terms, these should be explained in a
  glossary
  \item Each requirement must have its own \textbf{acceptance criteria}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item these will be important for the validation phase
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Design}\label{design}

This chapter explains the strategies used to meet the requirements
identified in the analysis. Ideally, the design should be the same,
regardless of the technological choices made during the implementation
phase.
